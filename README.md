Phonebook: 
  This project functions as a phone book for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address
  in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries.
  
  
Check Files GUI:
  This project allows the user to choose and transfer all .txt files from one chosen directory to another. All files that are moved will be
  saved in a database, and files edited/changes within the last 24 hours will be marked.
